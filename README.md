# bm3
MP3 playlist and album art processor for BMW's iDrive

## Features
- Copy files from your local library to an USB stick for use in a BMW's iDrive system
- Integrate album covers from jpg and png files directly in the copied MP3 (does not affect the local library)
- Copy and verify the playlists on the USB stick so that they are recognised by the car's software
- Handle exclusion playlists so that only parts of the library are copied (handy if you have more music than what fits on your USB stick)

## Compatibility
Tested on:
- BMW 1 series F20 2016 (facelift)
- BMW 3 series G21 2022 (facelift)

This is pretty generic software. It could very well work on non-BMW cars as long as they support M3U playlists (2020 Kia's don't, for example).
